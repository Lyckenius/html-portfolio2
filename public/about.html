<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> My name is Amanda Lyckenius and I aspire to be a web developer. My previous, or for current for now, occupation is a registered nurse.<p/>

  <p> On my spare time I like to crochet, read books, and learn new things such as ceramics or write code. I also like to take long walks with my dog, watch movies and meet up friends for dinner or a drink.</p>
